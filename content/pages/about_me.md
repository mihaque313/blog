Hi, My name is Md Inzamamul Haque (Call me Inzy bdw 😁). 

Curious about the complexities of our world and our limited ability to comprehend them, I'm a computer science graduate working as software engineer in domain of Big data.

I write programs in  Java, Python and Scala; and needless to say, being a data developer, SQL is ought to be the spine 😅.

Have been working in Hadoop ecosystem having good level of comfort in Sqoop, Impala, Hive, Oozie, Spark, Solr.

I have managed infrastructure and DevOps responsiblities across my various projects varying from managing [Cloudera cluster](https://www.cloudera.com/products/open-source/apache-hadoop.html),  writing [Chef ](https://learn.chef.io/)cookbooks, Creating CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins and Docker, creating ETL pipelines using [Apache Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org).

In my free time I love to read books(mainly non-fiction), write Poems in Urdu and Hindi, participate in social service activities.
