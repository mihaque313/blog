Hi, My name is Md Inzamamul Haque (you can call me Inzy üòÅ). 

Curious about the complexities of our world and our limited ability to comprehend them, I'm a computer science graduate working as software engineer in domain of Big data.

I write programs mainly in Java and Python, write cypher-queries for neo4j graphDB, regularly write bash scripts mainly for automation purposes, and sql is the constant buddy! ü§ò

Have been working in Hadoop ecosystem having good level of comfort in Sqoop, Impala, Hive, Oozie. Have started writing basic Spark applications too. 

I have also taken up infrastructure and DevOps responsibilities across my various projects varying from managing [Cloudera cluster](https://www.cloudera.com/products/open-source/apache-hadoop.html),  writing [Chef ](https://learn.chef.io/)cookbooks, Creating CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins and Docker, creating ETL pipelines using [Apache Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org).

In my free time I love to read books(mainly non-fiction), write poems in urdu and hindi.
